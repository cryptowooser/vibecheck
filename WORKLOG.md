# vibecheck — Worklog

## 2026-02-28

### Repository setup
- Created `vibecheck` repo
- Created README.md (full product brief)
- Created docs/PLAN.md (L0-L9 layer architecture, parallel tracks, tech stack)
- Created docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md (WU-01 through WU-27, dependency graph, testing strategy, directory structure)
- Created docs/DEMO.md, docs/ANALYSIS-vibe.md, docs/USING-VIBE.md, docs/TODO.md
- Created docs/REMOTING-UI.md (mobile-to-TUI bridge research)
- Updated AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md with correct `docs/` paths for all key files
- All cross-links verified (README ↔ docs/PLAN ↔ docs/IMPLEMENTATION)

### Reviewer 2 - Phase 0 audit (Vibe/Devstral)
- Reviewed WU-01/WU-02 scaffold output against `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` and `REVIEW-PROCESS.md`
- Executed verification checks (`npm run build`, pytest run, runtime API probe)
- Added findings and capability assessment to `docs/VIBE-REVIEW.md`
- Confirmed blockers: HTTP auth bypass, broken backend test fixture setup, and process non-compliance on commit/worklog hygiene

### Phase 0 punchlist reset (WU-01/WU-02)
- Updated `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` WU-01 to enforce strict PSK policy (`VIBECHECK_PSK` required, no default)
- Updated WU-01 route contract to `WS /ws/events/{session_id}` and session-id REST placeholders
- Updated WU-01 verification commands to explicit `export VIBECHECK_PSK=dev`, targeted auth tests, and full-suite gate
- Updated WU-02 mobile acceptance note to target 360px–428px phone widths and retained explicit frontend build gate

### Documentation consistency pass (README → PLAN → IMPLEMENTATION)
- Normalized session storage path references to `~/.vibe/logs/session/` across planning docs
- Standardized REST and WS route parameter naming to `{session_id}` across examples and WU specs
- Updated stale endpoint examples (`/api/approve`, `/api/input`, `/api/message`) to session-scoped paths
- Standardized status wording to `disconnected` (replacing mixed `detached` usage in API planning text)

### Phase 0 implementation (WU-01 + WU-02) redo
- Rebuilt Phase 0 from scratch in a clean tree using tests-first flow:
  - Added `vibecheck/tests/conftest.py` and `vibecheck/tests/test_auth.py` before implementation.
  - Confirmed red state first (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'vibecheck'`) using `uv run --with ... pytest`.
- Implemented backend scaffold (`WU-01`) with root-level `pyproject.toml` and importable `vibecheck/` package:
  - Added FastAPI app factory (`vibecheck/app.py`) with CORS, lifespan hook, API/WS router mounting.
  - Added strict PSK middleware (`vibecheck/auth.py`) with fail-fast `VIBECHECK_PSK` requirement and timing-safe compare.
  - Added stub REST routes (`vibecheck/routes/api.py`) and WS scaffold (`vibecheck/ws.py`) with connect event + 30s heartbeat.
  - Added runtime entrypoint (`vibecheck/__main__.py`) for `uv run python -m vibecheck`.
- Implemented frontend scaffold (`WU-02`) via `npm create vite@latest vibecheck/frontend -- --template svelte`:
  - Configured `vite.config.js` proxy (`/api`, `/ws`) to `localhost:7870` and build output to `../static`.
  - Replaced default app with mobile shell layout in `src/App.svelte` (safe-area insets, 44px targets, dark theme vars).
  - Added PWA files (`public/manifest.json`, `public/sw.js`) and registered SW in `src/main.js`.
  - Generated placeholder icons: `public/icons/vibe-192.png` and `public/icons/vibe-512.png`.
- Updated ignore policy:
  - Added `vibecheck/frontend/node_modules/` and `vibecheck/static/` to root `.gitignore`.
- Verification results:
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/test_auth.py -v` -> 6 passed.
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/ -v` -> 6 passed.
  - Backend smoke: `uv run python -m vibecheck` + `curl` checks (`/api/health` 200, `/api/state` with PSK 200, without PSK 401).
  - Frontend: `cd vibecheck/frontend && npm install && npm run build` succeeded; output in `vibecheck/static/`.
  - Frontend dev probe: `npm run dev` served on `:5173` and responded to `curl`.

### Reviewer 2 - Phase 0 reimplementation audit
- Reviewed commit `baf0fa0` and re-ran claimed verification commands:
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/test_auth.py -v` -> 6 passed
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/ -v` -> 6 passed
  - `cd vibecheck/frontend && npm run build` -> success
- Ran additional integration checks against backend-hosted frontend assets/PWA files.
- Logged findings in `docs/VIBE-REVIEW.md`: quality is improved, but backend static mount currently breaks root asset and PWA paths (`/assets/*`, `/manifest.json`, `/sw.js`, `/icons/*` returning 404).

### Reviewer 2 - static/PWA routing fix verification
- Reviewed commit `9be9622` (`fix: serve frontend PWA assets from backend root`).
- Re-ran claimed validations:
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/test_static_frontend.py -v` -> passed
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/test_auth.py -v` -> 6 passed
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/ -v` -> 7 passed
- Reproduced runtime smoke with backend server:
  - `/`, `/assets/index-*.js`, `/manifest.json`, `/sw.js`, `/icons/vibe-192.png` all returned 200
  - `/api/state` with PSK returned 200; without PSK returned 401
- Appended acceptance follow-up notes to `docs/VIBE-REVIEW.md`.

### Phase 2 implementation (WU-09 to WU-12)
- Implemented typed event models in `vibecheck/events.py` and added round-trip/validation coverage in `vibecheck/tests/test_events.py`.
- Built out `SessionBridge`/`SessionManager` in `vibecheck/bridge.py` with:
  - per-session state, pending approval/input futures, backlog cap, and session discovery from `~/.vibe/logs/session/`
  - fleet aggregation and session detail helpers for API consumers
- Replaced stub API routes with real session-backed endpoints in `vibecheck/routes/api.py`:
  - `GET /api/state`, `GET /api/sessions`, `GET /api/sessions/{session_id}`, `GET /api/sessions/{session_id}/state`
  - `POST /api/sessions/{session_id}/approve|input|message`
- Reworked WebSocket manager in `vibecheck/ws.py`:
  - session rooms (`rooms`, `socket_to_session`) with `connect` auth, `disconnect`, `broadcast`, `broadcast_all`, `send_personal`
  - connect flow sends `connected` + `state` + backlog, plus 30s heartbeat task
  - teardown hardened so heartbeat-task failures/cancellation do not skip disconnect cleanup
- Expanded API/WS/bridge tests:
  - `vibecheck/tests/test_api.py`
  - `vibecheck/tests/test_ws.py`
  - `vibecheck/tests/test_bridge.py`
- Updated auth state assertions in `vibecheck/tests/test_auth.py` to match dynamic session discovery (`/api/state` values are non-negative ints, not hardcoded zeros).
- Verification:
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/test_events.py -v` -> passed
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/test_bridge.py -v` -> passed
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/test_api.py -v` -> passed
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/test_ws.py -v` -> passed
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/ -v` -> passed (34 tests)
  - backend smoke: `uv run python -m vibecheck` + `curl http://127.0.0.1:7870/api/health` returned `{"status":"ok"}`

### Live Vibe tap probe script (external process reality check)
- Added `scripts/probe_live_vibe_session.py` to probe a real session log under `~/.vibe/logs/session/` and print:
  - discovered target session metadata
  - parsed last-N events (`user_message`, `assistant`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`)
  - optional short tail window for new live log lines
  - explicit capability verdict that callback control cannot be attached from an external running `vibe` process
- Added reusable probe helpers in `vibecheck/live_probe.py` and test coverage in `vibecheck/tests/test_live_probe.py`.
- Verification:
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/test_live_probe.py -v` -> passed
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/ -v` -> passed (38 tests)
  - `uv run python scripts/probe_live_vibe_session.py --tail-seconds 3 --show-last 4` -> passed against live session logs

### Session attachment deep-dive analysis
- Added `docs/ANALYSIS-session-attachment.md` to clarify the distinction between:
  - discovery/observe-only attach
  - replay/resume attach (new loop from history)
  - true live attach to the same already-running terminal process
- Documented current constraints of in-process callback wiring (`set_approval_callback`, `set_user_input_callback`) and why unmanaged external `vibe` processes are not automatically controllable.
- Added recommended roadmap clarifications, attach-mode capability contract, incremental implementation plan, and validation criteria for the "coffee-walk control" promise.

### CRITICAL: Architecture gap identified — bridge creates new AgentLoop, cannot attach to running Vibe
- **Problem:** Phase 2's `SessionBridge` creates its own `AgentLoop` via `_ensure_agent_loop()`. It cannot control an already-running Vibe terminal process. Vibe has zero IPC — `set_approval_callback()` and `set_user_input_callback()` are in-process method calls, not network endpoints. The product promise ("run Vibe in terminal, control from phone") was impossible with the Phase 2 architecture.
- **Analysis:** Evaluated four architecture options:
  - **Option A: Managed startup** — vibecheck replaces vibe. Works but users lose Vibe's Textual TUI (rich tool approval dialogs, streaming output, syntax highlighting). This is what Phase 2 builds. Not acceptable because the UX promise requires terminal + mobile.
  - **Option B: Sidecar injection into Vibe's entry point** — `vibecheck-vibe` wraps Vibe's CLI. Same process runs Textual TUI + FastAPI/WebSocket server. One shared AgentLoop. **SELECTED.**
  - **Option C: tmux/PTY sidecar** — Terminal scraping. Fragile (heuristic parsing, keystroke simulation, state drift). Used by Happy and other Claude Code remoting apps — their UX shows the limitations. **Fallback only.**
  - **Option D: Upstream ACP** — Vibe's `resume_session()` is `NotImplemented`. Not viable for hackathon timeline.
- **Key architectural insight from Vibe source analysis:** In `vibe/cli/cli.py`, the flow is: create `AgentLoop` (line ~190) → pass to `run_textual_ui(agent_loop=agent_loop)` (line ~203). The TUI and AgentLoop are independent objects. Textual is built on asyncio. We can run uvicorn alongside it as a Textual worker in the same event loop.
- **Decision:** Option B primary, Option C fallback. User confirmed.

### Phase 3 (Live Attach) inserted into planning docs
- **`docs/ANALYSIS-session-attachment.md`** — Complete rewrite replacing colleague's initial draft. Now contains:
  - Problem statement (Vibe has no IPC)
  - Three attachment modes (observe-only, replay/resume, live attach)
  - Four architecture options with honest tradeoffs
  - Decision rationale (Option B primary, Option C fallback)
  - Detailed Option B architecture: single asyncio loop, bridge owns AgentLoop, event tee pattern, dual input, approval flow
  - Session API contract with `attach_mode` values
  - Acceptance test definition
  - Risk/mitigation table
- **`docs/PLAN.md`** — Updated:
  - Architecture diagram: now shows `vibecheck-vibe` with terminal + phone as parallel surfaces
  - Inserted Layer 1.5 (Live Attach) between L1 and L2
  - Updated dependency graph: L1.5 is prerequisite for all higher layers
  - Updated parallelism map: added L1.5 row (backend-only)
  - Updated Track A: added L1.5 entry
  - Fixed "In-process vs sidecar?" open question to reference Option B
- **`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`** — Major restructure:
  - Inserted new **Phase 3: Live Attach (L1.5)** with four work units:
    - WU-25: Bridge `attach_to_loop()` — wire callbacks on existing AgentLoop, add `attach_mode` field
    - WU-26: Event tee + TUI bridge rendering — `TuiBridge` adapter, event fan-out to TUI + WebSocket
    - WU-27: VibeCheckApp + launcher — Textual subclass, uvicorn as worker, `vibecheck-vibe` entry point
    - WU-28: Live attach integration test — mocked AgentLoop, real FastAPI, acceptance test
  - Renumbered all subsequent phases: Phase 3→4, 4→5, 5→6, 6→7, 7→8
  - Renumbered stretch WUs to avoid collision: WU-25→29, WU-26→30, WU-27→31
  - Updated: ToC, dependency graph, constraints table, WU table, parallelism map, directory structure
  - Added new files to directory structure: `tui_bridge.py`, `launcher.py`, `test_tui_bridge.py`, `test_launcher.py`, `test_live_attach.py`
- All 44 existing tests pass after changes (doc-only commit, no code changes).

### Reviewer 2 + Reviewer 3 findings on Phase 3 doc insertion
- Fixed 7 findings from Reviewer 2 and additional feedback from Reviewer 3:
  1. **Blocker fixed:** Normalized `act()` ownership — bridge is sole consumer in all modes (live + managed). Removed contradictory "TUI drives act() initially" language from IMPLEMENTATION.md.
  2. **High fixed:** Integration/deploy steps now reference `vibecheck-vibe` as primary startup path, with `python -m vibecheck` as standalone fallback.
  3. **High fixed:** Clarified discovered sessions are `observe_only` — live control requires sessions started via `vibecheck-vibe`. Added explicit notes in PLAN.md (L1 SessionManager, Open Questions) and IMPLEMENTATION.md (WU-12).
  4. **Medium fixed:** Gate labels corrected — Integration #1 says "after L1.5 + L2", stretch WUs reference Phase 5 gate.
  5. **Medium fixed:** Added `controllable` property alongside `attach_mode` in PLAN.md and IMPLEMENTATION.md — derived from mode, used by frontend to show/hide controls.
  6. **Medium fixed:** Normalized approval surface — both TUI keyboard and mobile REST can resolve pending approvals (first response wins). Per Reviewer 3: this is required for "go back and forth" UX, not stretch.
  7. **Low fixed:** Updated WU range from WU-27 to WU-31 in README.md and AGENTS.md.
- Added explicit Textual + uvicorn spike step in WU-27 (highest technical risk).
- Files changed: `docs/ANALYSIS-session-attachment.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`

### Phase 3 implementation (WU-25 to WU-28)
- Implemented live-attach bridge capabilities in `vibecheck/bridge.py`:
  - Added `attach_to_loop(agent_loop, vibe_runtime)` for wiring callbacks/message observer onto an existing AgentLoop.
  - Added `attach_mode` (`live|managed|observe_only|replay`) and derived `controllable` property on `SessionBridge`.
  - Added bridge event listeners (`add_event_listener` / `remove_event_listener`) and fan-out so bridge events can tee to multiple consumers.
  - Extended state/session payloads to include `attach_mode` and `controllable`.
  - Updated `SessionManager.attach()` mode selection: discovered sessions default to `observe_only`; unmanaged new sessions default to `managed`.
- Added `vibecheck/tui_bridge.py` with `TuiBridge` adapter (`on_bridge_event`) to forward bridge events to Textual-style `handle_event(...)`.
- Added `vibecheck/launcher.py` and `VibeCheckApp`:
  - Launcher parses `--ws-port`, builds AgentLoop from Vibe runtime, attaches bridge in `live` mode, and runs TUI app.
  - `VibeCheckApp` starts uvicorn server worker with `log_level=\"warning\"` and routes TUI turn handling through `bridge.inject_message()` so bridge remains sole `act()` consumer.
- Registered CLI entrypoint in `pyproject.toml`:
  - `[project.scripts] vibecheck-vibe = "vibecheck.launcher:launch"`.
- Added Phase 3 tests:
  - `vibecheck/tests/test_tui_bridge.py`
  - `vibecheck/tests/test_launcher.py`
  - `vibecheck/tests/test_live_attach.py`
  - Expanded `vibecheck/tests/test_bridge.py` for live attach behavior and attach-mode semantics.
- Added `scripts/test_live_attach.sh` smoke/integration script.
- Verification run:
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/test_bridge.py vibecheck/tests/test_tui_bridge.py vibecheck/tests/test_launcher.py vibecheck/tests/test_live_attach.py -v` -> passed.
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/ -v` -> 54 passed.
  - `scripts/test_live_attach.sh` -> passed.
  - `uv run python -m vibecheck` startup smoke + `curl /api/health` -> `{\"status\":\"ok\"}`.

### Phase 3 reviewer feedback fixes (callback ownership + raw event tee)
- Addressed Reviewer 1/2 blocker on callback ownership in `vibecheck/launcher.py`:
  - `VibeCheckApp.on_mount()` now rebinds bridge callbacks after `super().on_mount()`.
  - Added callback interceptors on `agent_loop.set_approval_callback` / `set_user_input_callback` so future rebinds (including agent switches) keep bridge ownership while preserving TUI callbacks as local fallback resolvers.
- Addressed event type mismatch for TUI tee:
  - Added raw event listener channel in `SessionBridge` (`add_raw_event_listener`, `_notify_raw_event_listeners`).
  - `_run_agent_turn()` now fans out raw AgentLoop events to raw listeners before conversion for WebSocket payloads.
  - `VibeCheckApp` now connects TUI bridge via raw channel, so Textual `EventHandler` receives upstream Vibe event objects.
- Hardened bridge callback orchestration:
  - Added optional local callback racing in `SessionBridge` so local TUI approval/input callbacks can resolve the same pending futures (first response wins behavior).
  - Extended message observer wiring to also patch `agent_loop.messages._observer` when present.
  - Replaced silent listener exception swallowing with logger-backed exceptions.
- Hardened launcher lifecycle:
  - Added uvicorn server handle tracking and graceful `should_exit` signaling on unmount.
  - `_handle_agent_loop_turn()` now surfaces failed bridge injection via TUI notification.
  - `_build_agent_loop()` now accepts a `message_observer` parameter; launcher bootstrap uses bridge observer at loop construction.
- Updated `scripts/test_live_attach.sh` to smoke the launcher entry point (`uv run vibecheck-vibe --help`) in addition to integration and backend startup checks.
- Added/expanded tests for fixes:
  - `test_bridge.py`: raw event listener path + local callback resolution path.
  - `test_tui_bridge.py`: raw event forwarding.
  - `test_launcher.py`: message observer forwarding and callback rebind/interceptor behavior.
- Verification run after fixes:
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/ -v` -> 59 passed.
  - `scripts/test_live_attach.sh` -> passed.

### Phase 3 reviewer follow-up fixes (mobile-first race + method matching)
- Fixed mobile-first resolution race in `vibecheck/bridge.py`:
  - Removed cancellation of local callback tasks after REST resolution.
  - Added local callback state settlement helpers to resolve Vibe TUI pending futures safely:
    - `_settle_local_approval_state(...)` sets `_pending_approval` result when mobile resolves first.
    - `_settle_local_input_state(...)` sets `_pending_question` result when mobile resolves first.
  - Wired settlement into `resolve_approval(...)` and `resolve_input(...)`.
- Fixed interceptor bound-method comparison in `vibecheck/launcher.py`:
  - Added `_callbacks_match(...)` helper using `__func__` + `__self__` semantics instead of identity-only `is`.
  - Prevents self-referential local fallback assignment when callback passed is bridge callback.
- Strengthened test coverage:
  - Added `test_mobile_resolution_does_not_leave_local_pending_state_stuck` in `vibecheck/tests/test_bridge.py`.
  - Extended launcher callback interception test in `vibecheck/tests/test_launcher.py` to assert bridge callback re-registration does not overwrite local fallback callbacks.
- Improved `scripts/test_live_attach.sh` smoke flow:
  - Added launcher wiring smoke test (`test_on_mount_rebinds_callbacks_and_intercepts_future_rebinds`) so the script now exercises callback interception behavior, not only `--help`.
- Verification run after follow-up:
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/test_bridge.py vibecheck/tests/test_launcher.py vibecheck/tests/test_tui_bridge.py -v` -> passed.
  - `scripts/test_live_attach.sh` -> passed.
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/ -v` -> 60 passed.

### Phase 3 race-window hardening (late local task start)
- Closed the remaining late-start window in `vibecheck/bridge.py`:
  - `_resolve_with_local_approval(...)` now returns immediately if `tool_call_id` is no longer pending.
  - `_resolve_with_local_input(...)` now returns immediately if `request_id` is no longer pending.
- Added regression tests in `vibecheck/tests/test_bridge.py`:
  - `test_late_local_approval_task_skips_after_mobile_resolution`
  - `test_late_local_input_task_skips_after_mobile_resolution`
  - Both tests delay local callback task start and verify no stuck local pending future after mobile-first resolution.
- Verification:
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/test_bridge.py vibecheck/tests/test_launcher.py vibecheck/tests/test_tui_bridge.py -v` -> passed.
  - `scripts/test_live_attach.sh` -> passed.
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/ -q` -> 62 passed.

### Phase 3.1 (TUI Integration Hardening) — planning inserted
- **Source:** External reviewer validated Option B approach and identified three TUI integration gaps that unit tests cannot catch (they require the real Vibe Textual app).
- **Gap 1 (High):** TUI stuck in approval/question widget after mobile resolves. Our `_settle_local_approval_state()` resolves the asyncio Future but doesn't trigger Vibe's Textual UI cleanup (`on_approval_app_*` handlers). The approval widget stays mounted, input area stays hidden.
- **Gap 2 (Medium):** Mobile-injected prompts invisible in TUI. Vibe's `EventHandler.handle_event()` intentionally no-ops on `UserMessageEvent` because the TUI mounts the widget before `act()`. Phone-injected messages skip that mount → "ghost conversations" in terminal.
- **Gap 3 (Medium):** `_handle_agent_loop_turn` override drops loading widget lifecycle, Ctrl+C interrupt behavior, and history refresh. Queue serialization replaces `_agent_running` guard (equivalent), but the other losses are visible.
- **Docs updated:**
  - `docs/ANALYSIS-session-attachment.md` — Added "Phase 3 Validation: Confirmed Gaps" section with full technical detail and Vibe source references
  - `docs/PLAN.md` — Added Phase 3.1 status note under L1.5 with summary of all three gaps
  - `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` — Inserted Phase 3.1 with WU-32 (approval UI cleanup, M), WU-33 (remote injection UX + lifecycle audit, S), WU-34 (manual validation with real Vibe, S). Updated ToC, dependency graph, WU table, key constraints, parallelism map, and Phase 5 gate dependencies.

### Phase 3.1 implementation (WU-32 + WU-33 documentation pass)
- Implemented explicit local TUI cleanup hook in `vibecheck/bridge.py`:
  - Added `_reset_local_owner_ui(owner)` to call owner `_switch_to_input_app()` when present.
  - Wired the cleanup into both `_settle_local_approval_state(...)` and `_settle_local_input_state(...)` after future settlement.
  - Behavior is async-safe: awaitables are scheduled on the active loop and tracked with bridge background task management.
- Strengthened regression coverage in `vibecheck/tests/test_bridge.py`:
  - Extended `test_mobile_resolution_does_not_leave_local_pending_state_stuck` to assert `_switch_to_input_app()` is invoked after mobile approval/input resolution.
  - Ensures the bridge now updates both asyncio state and local TUI mode state.
- Documented WU-33 lifecycle/UX tradeoffs:
  - `README.md` now includes a "Live Attach Known Limitations (Phase 3.1)" section covering:
    - user-prompt visibility limitation for phone-injected `UserMessageEvent` in terminal TUI
    - deliberate `_handle_agent_loop_turn` lifecycle tradeoffs (loading indicator, interrupt, history refresh)
  - Added inline parity-tradeoff comment in `vibecheck/launcher.py` next to `_handle_agent_loop_turn`.
- Verification:
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/test_bridge.py::test_mobile_resolution_does_not_leave_local_pending_state_stuck -v` -> passed
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/test_bridge.py vibecheck/tests/test_launcher.py vibecheck/tests/test_tui_bridge.py vibecheck/tests/test_live_attach.py -v` -> passed (27 tests)
  - `uv run pytest vibecheck/tests/ -q` -> passed (62 tests)
  - `scripts/test_live_attach.sh` -> passed

### WU-34 manual validation harness (operator error reduction)
- Added a structured manual-test toolkit under `scripts/manual-test/`:
  - `run.sh` — interactive scenario runner for Phase 3.1/WU-34 with hard acceptance checks and per-scenario pass/fail capture.
  - `api.sh` — session API helper (state inspection, wait-for-pending, resolve approval/input, send message).
  - `tui_prompts.sh` — canonical TUI prompts for each manual scenario (approve/reject/question/race/reconnect/running).
  - `capture.sh` — starts `vibecheck-vibe` with `script` transcript capture into timestamped artifacts.
  - `README.md` — runbook for multi-terminal execution (Terminal A/B + phone).
- Added ignore rules to keep manual artifacts/secrets out of git:
  - `artifacts/manual-test/`
  - `scripts/manual-test/.env.local`
- Harness output:
  - `artifacts/manual-test/wu34-<timestamp>/results.tsv`
  - `artifacts/manual-test/wu34-<timestamp>/report.md` (commit hash, Vibe version, scenario table, pasteback summary)
- Script verification:
  - `bash -n scripts/manual-test/api.sh scripts/manual-test/run.sh scripts/manual-test/capture.sh scripts/manual-test/tui_prompts.sh`
  - `scripts/manual-test/run.sh --help`
  - `scripts/manual-test/api.sh --help`
  - `scripts/manual-test/tui_prompts.sh list`
  - `scripts/manual-test/capture.sh --help`
