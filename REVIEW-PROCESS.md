This doc is only for REVIEWERS, not the CODER.

- Reviewers will carefully check the code generated by the primary CODER (Mistral Vibe, Devstral 2)
- Reviewers should make sure that code adheres to the README.md, docs/PLAN.md, and docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md and that the AGENTS.md has been respected to minimize drift and ensure quality
- Besides giving the users summary/feedback, we will also give feedback to the CODER and *ALSO* write down our corrections, feedback, etc to docs/VIBE-REVIEW.md so that at the end of the Hackathon project we will have a good summary of how Mistral Vibe/Devstral 2 performed as a coding agent.
